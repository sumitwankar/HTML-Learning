<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <!-- In head section only two part are visiable in browser and that is title,favicon. -->
    <!-- Content in the head section, like metadata, CSS links, etc. -->
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Content in the body section, visible to users on the webpage -->
    <!-- HTML is indeed a syntactical language, and it is both simple and declarative in nature. -->
    <!-- the h1 and h2 tags isn't about the visible size of headings on the UI. It's important to note that HTML tags provide a semantic hierarchy to content. H1 is highest level of importance and h2 being a subheading of lesser importance.-->

    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <h2>Subheading</h2>
    
    <!-- HTML tags are indeed case-insensitive. -->
    <br />
</body>

</html>



3. HTML tags are indeed case-insensitive. This means that you can write tags in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture of both, and the browser will interpret them the same way. For example, <html>, <HTML>, and <HtMl> are all treated as the same tag.
    4. In the "index.html" file, several HTML tags are present. In the beginning, we encounter the "<!DOCTYPE html>" declaration, signifying the file's HTML type. Subsequently, the HTML file follows this structure:	
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <!-- Content in the head section, like metadata, CSS links, etc. -->
            </head>
            <body>
                <!-- Content in the body section, visible to users on the webpage -->
            </body>
            </html>
    Additionally, while the "title" tag in the head section contributes to what's displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, the "favicon" (shortcut icon) is a small image that appears next to the title in the browser tab or window.
